- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting / Vercel (Frontend) + Backend API Hosting (Node)

    Core Framework: Next.js (built on React) is the foundation of the app. We are using its App Router for modern, flexible routing and its static export capability to create a host-anywhere, serverless application.

    Language: The entire application is written in TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript. This helps prevent common bugs and makes the code more robust and easier to maintain.

    Styling:
        Tailwind CSS: For all the styling. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and consistent UI development directly within the HTML.
        ShadCN/UI: The pre-built, accessible, and themeable UI components (like buttons, cards, and dialogs) are from ShadCN/UI. This accelerates development while ensuring a high-quality user interface.
        Lucide React: All icons used throughout the application, such as the dollar sign and user icons, are from this lightweight and clean icon library.

    Data Storage:
        Browser Local Storage: All application data—including user profiles, groups, and bills—is stored directly in the user's browser. This makes the app completely serverless, ensures user privacy, and allows it to function entirely offline.

    State Management: We use React's built-in tools for managing application state:
        React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo): For managing component-level state and side effects.
        React Context API: For providing global state (like the current user and group data) to all components without having to pass props down through the entire component tree.
